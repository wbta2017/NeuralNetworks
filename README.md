# Building a neural network to determine the effect that the subreddit WallStreetBets has on the stock market.


After the stock frenzy surrounding GameStop stock occurred, the subreddit WallStreetBets got a lot of media attention as it was pointed to as the reason why the stock went through the roof, while Gamestop itself was on the verge of bankruptcy. 
This neural network will need to identify which companies are mentioned on the subreddit and weather they are mentioned positively or negatively and then track the price fluctuations of the stock in the hours preceding and hours after the post is created. Compiling data from many posts involving many stocks should give us an idea of the impact that an average post on the subreddit has. The amount of upvotes and interaction with the post should also be taken into account. This can at least partially illuminate the power that the subreddit has on the market.

# Goals: 
identify keywords in Reddit posts (stock names and positive vs negative words in the same post), compile data about the post such as upvotes and comments, see how the mentioned stock changes as a result of the post (did activity change after the post?), identify the total effect that the post had on the stock.
